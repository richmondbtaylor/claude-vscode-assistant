  Capture a website and create a HyperFrames video from it. Use when: (1) a user provides a URL and wants a video, (2) someone says "capture this site", "turn this into a video", "make a promo from my site", (3) the user wants a social ad, product tour, or any video based on an existing website, (4) the user shares a link and asks for any kind of video content. Even if the user just pastes a URL — this is the skill to use.

# Website to HyperFrames

Capture a website, then produce a professional video from it.

Users say things like:

- "Capture https://... and make me a 25-second product launch video"
- "Turn this website into a 15-second social ad for Instagram"
- "Create a 30-second product tour from https://..."

The workflow has 7 steps. Each produces an artifact that gates the next.

---

## Step 1: Capture & Understand

**Read:** [references/step-1-capture.md](references/step-1-capture.md)

Run the capture, read the extracted data, and build a working summary using the write-down-and-forget method.

**Gate:** Print your site summary (name, top colors, fonts, key assets, one-sentence vibe).

---

## Step 2: Write DESIGN.md

**Read:** [references/step-2-design.md](references/step-2-design.md)

Write a simple brand reference for the captured website. 6 sections, ~90 lines. This is a cheat sheet, not the creative plan — that comes in Step 4.

**Gate:** `DESIGN.md` exists in the project directory.

---

## Step 3: Write SCRIPT

**Read:** [references/step-3-script.md](references/step-3-script.md)

Write the narration script. The story backbone. Scene durations come from the narration, not from guessing.

**Gate:** `SCRIPT.md` exists in the project directory.

---

## Step 4: Write STORYBOARD

**Read:** [references/step-4-storyboard.md](references/step-4-storyboard.md)

Write per-beat creative direction: mood, camera, animations, transitions, assets, depth layers, SFX. This is the creative north star — the document the engineer follows to build each composition.

**Gate:** `STORYBOARD.md` exists with beat-by-beat direction and an asset audit table.

---

## Step 5: Generate VO + Map Timing

**Read:** [references/step-5-vo.md](references/step-5-vo.md)

Generate TTS audio, transcribe for word-level timestamps, and map timestamps to beats. Update STORYBOARD.md with real durations.

**Gate:** `narration.wav` (or .mp3) + `transcript.json` exist. Beat timings in STORYBOARD.md updated.

---

## Step 6: Build Compositions

**Read:** The `hyperframes` skill (load it — every rule matters)
**Read:** [references/step-6-build.md](references/step-6-build.md)

Build each composition following the storyboard. After each one: self-review for layout, asset placement, and animation quality.

**Gate:** Every composition has been self-reviewed. No overlapping elements, no misplaced assets, no static images without motion.

---

## Step 7: Validate & Deliver

**Read:** [references/step-7-validate.md](references/step-7-validate.md)

Lint, validate, snapshot, preview. Deliver the preview to the user first — only render to MP4 on explicit request.

**Gate:** `npx hyperframes lint` and `npx hyperframes validate` pass with zero errors.

## Design bridges: consult before building

Three bridge skills sit under this one. None of them produces deliverables; this
skill still owns the output.

1. **`design-extract`** — MEASURED tokens from one named site, repo, or project.
   When a design system is active it wins on layout, spacing, type scale,
   components, motion and interaction states.
2. **`design-intel`** — RECOMMENDED generic values (layout, spacing, UX,
   accessibility, chart selection, font pairing) where brand and the active
   system are silent.
3. **`design-sources`** — external craft rules plus the deterministic gate. Read
   `C:/Users/richm/.claude/skills/design-sources/references/web-ui.md` for this medium.

**Precedence:** explicit instruction in the request > `branding-agent` (colours,
fonts, logo) > active extracted system > style preset (`brutalist-skill`,
`minimalist-skill`) > `design-intel` > skill defaults. Measured beats
recommended where both cover a decision. Borrow ratios and structure from an
extracted system; keep brand colours and typefaces from `branding-agent`.

`design-sources` is a **gate, not a precedence layer**: it runs before shipping
no matter which layer supplied the values.

3. **Gate before delivery (blocking).** Any HTML you produce must reach exit 0:
   ```bash
   python C:/Users/richm/.claude/skills/design-sources/scripts/check_design.py <file> --mobile
   ```
   The gate is the standard, not your own read of the page. Never call a page clean without running it.

**Brand outranks both.** Bishop AI / Prompt Anything / BOB colours and typefaces
come from `branding-agent` and `tokens.json`, never from an external source.
Verified: Bishop AI's own palette trips two Impeccable rules (`cream-palette` on
warm-white `#F9F6F0`, `overused-font` on Open Sans); both are waived in
`C:/Users/richm/.claude/design-sources/brand-overrides/config.json` and reported as overridden
rather than failed. Do not "fix" brand to satisfy a detector.
